Redux Toolkit: Understanding the Core Concepts
1Ô∏è‚É£ Key Concepts of Redux
Redux primarily works with four main functions:

Store ‚Üí Manages the global state of the application.
Reducers ‚Üí Functions that define how the state should change based on actions.
Actions ‚Üí Objects that tell Redux what to do (contain a type and payload).
Dispatch ‚Üí Sends actions to reducers to update the state.
useSelector
2Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up the Redux Store
Step 1: Create a Store File
Inside the app folder, create a file named store.js.
The store acts like Context API‚Äôs global state but for Redux.
Step 2: Configure the Store
In store.js, set up the store using Redux Toolkit's configureStore():

javascript
Copy
Edit
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

export const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {}
});
üîπ Explanation:

configureStore({}) creates the Redux store.
Later, we will add reducers inside reducer: {}.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Reducers (Slices)
Reducers in Redux Toolkit are called slices.

Step 1: Organizing Features
Inside the features/ folder, create a file for the slice.
For a Todo App, name it todoSlice.js.
Step 2: Define the Slice
A slice consists of:

Name (used internally in Redux).
Initial state (default values for the store).
Reducers (functions to handle state changes).
Example of a Todo Slice
javascript
Copy
Edit
import { createSlice, nanoid } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const initialState = {
    todos: [{ id: 1, title: "Example todo" }]
};

export const todoSlice = createSlice({
    name: "todo",
    initialState,
    reducers: {
        addTodo: (state, action) => {
            const todo = {
                id: nanoid(),
                title: action.payload
            };
            state.todos.push(todo);
        },
        removeTodo: (state, action) => {
            state.todos = state.todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== action.payload);
        }
    }
});
üîπ Explanation:

nanoid() generates a unique ID for each todo.
addTodo: Adds a new todo with the title from action.payload.
removeTodo: Filters out todos that do not match the given id.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding Actions and Payloads
What is an Action?
An action is a simple JavaScript object that tells Redux what happened.

javascript
Copy
Edit
{
  type: "todo/addTodo",
  payload: { text: "Learn Redux" }
}
What is a Payload?
Payload is the actual data sent with an action.
It informs reducers how to update the state.
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
dispatch(addTodo({ text: "Learn Redux Toolkit" }));
Here, the payload is { text: "Learn Redux Toolkit" }, so the reducer accesses it using action.payload.text.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Removing a Todo (Filter Logic)
The removeTodo function:

javascript
Copy
Edit
removeTodo: (state, action) => {
    state.todos = state.todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== action.payload);
}
üîπ How It Works:

state.todos contains all the todos.
.filter() keeps only todos whose IDs do not match the one provided in action.payload.
The matching todo is removed, and the state updates.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Exporting Actions and Reducers
Once the slice is created, export the necessary parts:

Exporting Action Creators
javascript
Copy
Edit
export const { addTodo, removeTodo } = todoSlice.actions;
üîπ This allows you to dispatch addTodo() and removeTodo() in components.

Exporting the Reducer
javascript
Copy
Edit
export default todoSlice.reducer;
üîπ This reducer will be added to store.js.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Finalizing the Store (Connecting Reducers)
Once the reducer is ready, connect it to the store:

javascript
Copy
Edit
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import todoReducer from "../features/todoSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
        todo: todoReducer
    }
});
üîπ Now, store knows about our Todo slice.

üéØ Summary
Step	Description
1. Create Store	Inside app/, create store.js and configure the store.
2. Create Reducers (Slices)	Inside features/, create a slice (e.g., todoSlice.js).
3. Define Actions & Reducers	Add addTodo and removeTodo functions.
4. Understand Payloads	Payload is the data inside action.payload.
5. Remove Items Correctly	Use .filter() to remove specific items from the state.
6. Export and Connect Everything	Export actions and reducers, then connect to store.js.
üí° Next Steps
Connect Redux to a React component using useSelector() and useDispatch().
Dispatch actions from a UI (e.g., a button click).
