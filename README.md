# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

i have worked on this project for my practice of MERN Stack development, i have used api's in my project from my localhost which is not the correct way but at the end of the project i will replace the apis with real online deployed endpoints.
